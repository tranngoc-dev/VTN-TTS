"""Precomputed voice packs.

A "voice" in ZeroTTS is a small array of speaker latents — shape
``(1, n_voice_queries, d_model)`` float32 — that gets prepended to the sequence.
That array is the *entire* speaker conditioning; there is no reference audio, no
transcript, and no prompt frames involved at generation time.

Those latents are produced by a voice encoder that reads a reference clip. **The
encoder is not part of this release**, so this package cannot create a voice
from a wav — it can only load ones that already exist. See the README, or
zeroweight.ai, for how to obtain latents for your own speaker.

That boundary is narrower than it sounds: a voice pack is just a .npz, so
latents obtained elsewhere drop into ``voices/<name>/voice.npz`` and work with
no code change. A pack does not even have to live under the model directory:
:func:`install_voice_zip` takes the zip a zeroweight.ai voice downloads as and
unpacks it into :data:`USER_VOICES_DIR`, where every later ``ZeroTTS`` picks it
up on its own — which is what :meth:`ZeroTTS.add_voices` calls.

Layout of a voice pack directory:

    voices/
      index.json                 # optional manifest: name, display_name, tags...
      <name>/
        voice.npz                # required: {n_voice_queries: int64, voice_emb: (1,Q,D) f32}
        voice.bin                # optional: raw f32 of voice_emb, for the JS demo
        preview.wav              # optional
        meta.json                # optional: display_name, gender, tags, description...
